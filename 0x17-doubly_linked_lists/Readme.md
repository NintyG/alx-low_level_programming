This repository contains solutions to the tasks and exercises related to doubly linked lists in the C programming language. Each task is implemented as a separate C file and comes with a corresponding header file.

Doubly linked lists are a type of linked data structure in which each node contains a pointer to the next as well as the previous node. This allows for efficient traversal in both directions.
